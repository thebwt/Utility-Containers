Stuff breaks -a lot- and sometimes you just need a general use docker container to get in there and figure stuff out. Along the way you want to vim something, "blah that means building an apt cache.. crap now I need something else". Well that's what I'm solving with this `docker `run -it --rm multitool` to the rescue. Fork and add things you thinks are good, PR it and see if I agree.
